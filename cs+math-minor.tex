Adding a math minor to your CS degree is one of the most beneficial degree 
combinations for a Computer Science major, especially if you are interested 
in machine learning, cryptography,  or doing research.  Your math minor will 
give you a good foundation in set theory, logic, and discrete probability, 
as well providing you with a high level of mathematical understanding.

\noindent Success in Physics classes, especially  Analytic Mechanics (PHYS 402), Electricity \& Magnetism (PHYS 407), and Quantum Mechanics (PHYS 419) require a firm understanding of mathematics. That might help explain why nationwide about one-third of undergraduate physics majors also earn a degree in mathematics. If you choose to attend a graduate program in physics, earning a math minor will help you be successful with the math intense first year core physics graduate classes.

The nine credits of mathematics classes beyond the requirements for your Physics Comprehensive will count toward your required 20 credits of unrestricted electives.

\subsection*{\textbf{\textcolor{unkblue}{Adding a Math Minor to your Major\myfootnote}}}

As you may know, at UNK every Bachelor of Science program of study requires a second
major or minor. So supplementing your major with a math minor is not only a great
way to build your resum\'e, but it also fulfills a degree requirement.

By choosing to take Calculus I with Analytic Geometry (five credits) to satisfy
your LOPER 4 General Studies requirement, you will gain five credits out of a
required twenty-four for a mathematics minor. That leaves only nineteen credits
to complete a math minor.  Of these remaining credits, six are electives, allowing
you to choose from classes ranging from History of Mathematics to Statistics.
